# HashTable Implementation in C

This project is an implementation of a HashTable data structure in C programming language, using the djb2 hash function.

## Features

- Implementation of a HashTable with key-value pairs.
- Utilizes the djb2 hash function for hashing keys.
- Provides functionalities for insertion, deletion, and retrieval of elements.
- Handles collision resolution using chaining method.

## How to Use

To use this HashTable implementation in your C project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Include the necessary files (`hashtable.c`, `hashtable.h`) in your project.
3. Implement the necessary logic to interact with the HashTable functions (insert, delete, retrieve).

## Example Usage

See main.c file

## TODO

- [ ] **Fix Capacity Issue:** Currently, there might be a capacity limitation in the HashTable implementation. Investigate and resolve any issues related to capacity constraints to ensure scalability and efficient usage.
